// Memory handling, including garbage collector
// GLIIMLY memory is made for request-based processing. Simplest form of memory management is for 
// memory to be allocated anywhere and released at the end of the request, GLIIMLY will de-allocate 
// it automatically. 'string' is memory and is any binary or text memory. Objects such as indexes, arrays,
// lists, split strings etc are never freed; but the items they hold (aka elements, mostly key/values) can be freed when
// an element is deleted; however superstructure of an index, array etc remains but is miniscule in memory footprint.
// Process-scoped memory will never be automatically released, but it can be deleted with delete-string.
// Each string has a reference count - note it's not a variable that has refcount, but a region of memory that variable(s) point to. 
// When a new memory is created (such as write-string or random-string), and a variable points to it in a statement,
// then its refcount is zero. When a variable X is assigned to variable Y (Y=X), then the refcount of memory pointed by Y is
// decreased by 1, and refcount of memory pointed by X is increased by 1; except when Y==X (meaning both X and Y point to the 
// same memory) in which case nothing is done. Data in elements (such as index, array etc) have refcount increased when created; so
// insert into index or list from a variable means such data has refcount +1. When element data is updated, then old data's refcount
// is decreased by 1, and variable's that's used to update is increased by 1. Parameters (get/set-param), cookies and request body (request-body)
// get refcount of 1 when assigned to variable (get-param, request-body); set-param will decrease old param's refcount by 1 and increase
// new one's by 1. When refcount is 0 and we decrease it, memory is freed. When a scope exits (like {} or start/end-loop) all local variables
// are freed - the actual memory may still be there is memory has refcount>0 such as if assigned to process-scope variable. 
// Scope also means call-handler and before/after handlers. Note that process-scope memory, even if refcount is 0, won't be freed until the end of
// the request.
